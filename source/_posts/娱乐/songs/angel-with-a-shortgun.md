*I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
An angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
Get out your guns, battle's begun,
are you a saint or a sinner?
If love's a fight, then I shall die,
with my heart on trigger.*

*They say before you start a war,
you better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.*

*I'm an angel with a shotgun,
fighting til' the war's won.
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.*

*Don't you know you're everything I have?
and I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.*

*Somethings to win, you've got to sin,
don't mean I'm not a believer,
and Major Tom will sing along.
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer.*

*They say before you start a war,
you better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.*

I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?

and I, want to live, not just survive, tonight.
(Live, not just survive)
and I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight.*

you better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.*
