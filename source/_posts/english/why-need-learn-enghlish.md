description: I have to learn English well, otherwise I may not be able to speak one sentence completely in the future. This is dreadful news, but no great surprise.

<!-- 以下所有内容均系本人愚见，万勿见怪 -->
All the following content is my own foolish opinion, no offense please.

My native language is Chinese, but I have to use English to express myself from now on in future. My English is very poor, and think of this I feel sad.

Why? Why I have to learn English? Why I have to write English?

Well, just because Chinese may only have two characters in the future. One is 「口」, another is 「￿」.

On the other hand, maybe I'm not a Chinese. I don't have ¥500,000 in cash, so I'm not qualified to be Chinese.
